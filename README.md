## __Why we chose Swift__ 

Mobile apps and games are something that many interact with everyday. In addition, mobile app development sounds like a field worth touching upon given the widespread popularity of these mobile devices. Besides this popularity, mobile app development just sounds like a really fun field to be in, because you get the opportunity to see your code and graphics work hand in hand to produce a highly interactable piece of software, such as a small game, or a food app, etc. Swift is a programming language that has been designed for the development of mobile apps and games for iOS devices, so this is why we decided to pick this as our programming language.

## __A Overview on the History of Swift__

Swift is a very young object oriented programming language that incorporates various ideas from Objective-C, Python, C# and more, with the very first version being announced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014 (1, 2). Actual development of the Swift programming language was started in 2010 by Chris Lattner, with apple programmers joining the following year (1). Prior to swift, Objective-C was used to develop apps for apple devices, but Apple began to have concerns over the low safety level of Objective-C. Objective-C, being extremely close to C, ran the risk that a careless programmer may write a piece of software that accesses the incorrect memory addresses, which could lead to crashes and even security concerns (3). This low level of safety, combined with the increasing hardship of adding in new features that other programming languages were adopting with ease, motivated apple to search for a new programming language, leading them to Swift. Since version 1, swift has undergone major growth, with numerous versions being released. Swift has also been well received by developers around the world, coming in first place for the most loved language in 2015 (4). Swift also became an open source project in 2015, with the aim of advancing the original goals of making a language that is safe, fast, and is expressive, which Swift.org refers to as a fun to use syntax (5). In 2016 the first version of Swift as an open source project, Swift 3, was released (5). The most current version of Swift is version 5.1.2, with Swift 5.2 in the works (5).
